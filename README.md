## Technologies and Software
Java, IntelliJ

- CLI: Users can interact with the software via the command line interface menus.
- Display Options: Users can request full catalog or catalog items by members.
- Search Options: Users can search the catalog by item name, creator, or year.
## Project Takeaways
- This project tied together the very basics of Object Oriented Programming. After the project functioning, I iterated through my code and implemented variables to reduce code repetition and to make it more readable. This project also offered a lot of practice using conditional logic, loops, try-catch statements, creating classes and an interface class and command-line programs.
## What's next
-This project is completed. Future development could include a database with the ability for members to check items in and out.
